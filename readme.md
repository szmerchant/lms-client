# lms-client

The lms-client project is the UI portion of a Learning Management System (LMS) that I am building. This project is currently in its early stages with very minimal code as it's primarily a practice platform to explore and integrate various modern web technologies.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Helpful Commands

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf .next # clear webpack cache
```
